# Attack is the best defense
 While today’s network security is much stronger than it used to be, there are still some legacy systems that are using unencrypted communication means. A popular one is telnet. In this project, we will not go over ARP spoofing, but we’ll start by sniffing unencrypted traffic and getting information out of i. Sendgrid offers is an emailing service that provides state of the art secure system to send emails, but also supports a legacy unsecured way: telnet. You can create an account for free, which is what I did, and send an email using telnet:

### [0. ARP spoofing and sniffing unencrypted traffic](./0-sniffing)
* 


### [1. Dictionary attack](./1-dictionary_attack)
* Password-based authentication systems can be easily broken by using a dictionary attack (you’ll have to find your own password dictionary). Let’s try it on an SSH account.
