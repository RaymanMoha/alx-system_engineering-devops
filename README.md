***System Engineering and DevOps - Bash, Scripting, Web Stack/Web Stack Debugging, Networking & Security, CI/CD***

This repository contains programs written for the system engineering and DevOps track at Alx program. In these projects, I will work with Bash and practice writing Bash scripts to automate tasks. I will learn about the OSI model and various Linux networking tools. Further, I will be able to configured a distributed system - two web servers and one load balancer - for deployment of my AirBnB project using Nginx, HAProxy, certbot, ufw, and MySQL.
